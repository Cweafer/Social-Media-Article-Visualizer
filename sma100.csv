By focusing on those interfaces that are critical for the organisation of innovation-related activities, as well as on the degree of complexity of the knowledge base which is being mobilised, this study will seek to determine the exact nature, and the intensity, of the need for geographic proximity.

"9",0,34,"Globalization, far from eliminating the relevance of geography, brings to the surface the importance of location as a collector and repository of specialized knowledge. In this “new age of capitalism”, regions are emerging as important catalysts for innovation and production development. This paper investigates the location patterns of R&D-intensive MNEs at the geographical micro-level. Analysis refers to the pharmaceutical industry, as one of the most active industries in FDI in R&D, and their foreign activities established in British regions. In this route, the present study develops a hierarchy of UK regions both on a technological and skills basis but also on a broader basis covering the overall macroeconomic environment. Results point towards a combination of corporate location strategies. High-technology firms are more likely to operate abroad in technology specialised large regions in accordance with regional hierarchical ordering. This pattern is consistent with MNEs’ commitment to access and tap into the specific technological assets embedded in the local knowledge systems and at the same time exploit their corporate-specific advantages in large markets.Globalization, far from eliminating the relevance of geography, brings to the surface the importance of location as a collector and repository of specialized knowledge.

Regions, which are territories with specific institutional and techno-economic characteristics, will be considered here as significant contexts for innovation processes. By using the word Â“contextÂ”, we want to underline the importance of regional characteristics, even in a globalised economy, but we are reluctant to speak of regional Â“systemÂ” without carefully analysing the possible meaning of such a notion. RIS is a useful concept if it one stresses its cognitive content - a way of interacting that leads to specific competence to innovate - but can be misleading if understood as an ex ante given network of actors and infrastructures. An important characterisation of territorial specificity in evolutionary terms is the cognitive potential of actors. For instance, firms"" capabilities vary to a large extent following the type of innovation under consideration : outcome of science-based R&D, particular competitiveness in marketing innovative products, incremental improvements through learning by using (N. Rosenberg) or other sort of learning by interacting (B-A. Lundvall). To give an empirical example, we will use the results of a survey of the French industry focusing on the innovative competence of the firms. We have developed an econometric model for testing the influence of the regional scientific and technological context on the nature of the Â“competence to innovateÂ” declared by the firms in the inquiry. This study is an opportunity to cast light on the concept of critical interfaces evoked by K. Pavitt (1998), by underlining several schemes of industrial development according to specific characteristics of industries and regions.

One of the empirical challenges is to go beyond this by understanding how the geography of innovation is shaped by particular structural properties of knowledge networks. This paper contributes to this challenge, focusing on the particular case of global navigation satellite systems at the European level. We exploit a database of R&D collaborative projects based on the fifth and sixth European Union Framework Programs, and apply social network analysis in economic geography. We study the properties both of the network of organizations and the network of collaborative projects. We show that the nature of the knowledge involved in relationships influences the geographical and structural organizations of the technological field. The observed coexistence of a relational core/periphery structure with a geographical cluster/pipeline one is discussed in the light of the industrial and geographical dynamics of technological standards.The concentration and dispersion of innovative activities in space have been largely explained and evidenced by the nature of knowledge and the geographical extent of knowledge spillovers.
